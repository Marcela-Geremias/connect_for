<h1 align="center">Connect 4 </h1>

## Project
This project implements the classic Connect 4 game with the option to play against an AI using two decision-making algorithms: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning. The game allows you to choose between these algorithms and configure the search depth (ply) to test the performance of each.
The encryption key is set as a fixed string ("minhaChaveSecreta"), but it can be easily modified to suit the user's needs.
